# hello-world

This is my first Github experience.

My name is Lam and I attend Drexel University as a Computer Science major.
I spend a majority of my time playing video games such as: League of Legends, Osu!, MapleStory
I really want to commit myself to the coding world and work behind the scenes of how games are created.
